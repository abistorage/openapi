  The ABI Storage API uses *Bearer Tokens* to authenticate requests. You can
  view and manage your tokens in the [ABI Storage
  Dashboard](https://abi.storage).   


  Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not
  share your *secret tokens* in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub,
  client-side code, and so forth.   


  **Bearer authentication** (also called token authentication) is an HTTP
  authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The
  name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer
  of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the
  server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the
  Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:


  ```js

  Authorization: Bearer <token>

  ```
type: http
scheme: bearer
bearerFormat: JWT
