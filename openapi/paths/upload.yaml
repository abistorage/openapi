    Store a file with abi.storage.

    You can upload either a single file or multiple files in a directory


    Send the POST request with one of:

    - a single file as a single Blob/File Object as the body

    - multiple files as FormData with `Content-Disposition` headers for each
    part to specify filenames and the request header `Content-Type:
    multipart/form-data`.


    You can also upload a Content Addressed Archive (CAR) file, by setting the
    request body as a single CAR Blob/File object and providing the request
    header `Content-Type: application/car`

    Providing a CAR file allows you to pre-compute the root CID for 1 or more
    files, ensures that the abi.storage will store and provide your assets with
    the same CID.
